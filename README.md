# Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) AGI 2: Resources, Tools, and Exploration Journey

> “Pushing the boundaries of understanding intelligence through the lens of abstraction and reasoning.”

In my pursuit of understanding intelligence and contributing to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), I have put together this repository as a living collection of research papers centered on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). It is a space that reflects my own exploration: both the excitement and the challenges: while aiming to serve as a resource for others passionate about this field. 

This effort is a small piece of a larger pursuit I am working toward: building AI systems that do not just assist research but actively drive scientific discovery. By curating these papers and sharing tools and opportunities, I hope to connect ideas, people, and resources, all unified under the goal of advancing our grasp of reasoning and generalization in machines. It is a journey in progress, and I am eager to see it grow with input from the community, and also from my own work.

This repository is preliminary: expect updates, shifts, and expansions as I learn more and as new insights emerge. Alongside the papers, I have added resources like compute grants that I’ve found helpful, especially for the ARC Prize 2025, and a glimpse into my broader research vision. Everything here ties back to that singular aim of pushing intelligence forward, step by step.

## Introduction

This repository is a comprehensive resource hub for research papers focused on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a benchmark designed to test AI systems on reasoning and generalization. It is born out of my own curiosity and a desire to contribute something meaningful to the AGI community. By organizing research, I hope to spark collaboration and innovation among researchers, practitioners, and anyone else drawn to this challenge.

### Why This Repository?
- **Centralized Knowledge**: A curated, accessible collection of ARC related research.
- **Categorized Insights**: Papers grouped by themes to make exploration easier.
- **Dynamic Updates**: A flexible space that’ll evolve with new findings and contributions.

#### A Personal Note

Searching for compute support was a bit of a trek, but finding these opportunities felt like a win. I have been lucky to get accepted for most of them (except Strong Compute, which I skipped for now), and I am still waiting to hear back from Google. Sharing this feels right: it is something I wish I would known about sooner, and I hope it saves someone else some time. Good luck to everyone tackling the ARC Prize 2025: I am rooting for us all.
